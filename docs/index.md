View and edit line endings in Sublime Text.  RawLineEdit displays line endings very clearly and allows changing the line endings per line (something sublime text doesn't allow out of the box).

# Sublime Text 3 Support?
ST3 support is found here: https://github.com/facelessuser/RawLineEdit/tree/ST3.  All current development is being done on ST3.

# Sublime Text 2 Support?
