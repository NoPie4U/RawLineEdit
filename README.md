RawLineEdit
===========
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/342698/RawLineEdit/Example.png" border="0"/>

View and edit line endings in Sublime Text.  RawLineEdit displays line endings very clearly and allows changing the line endings per line (something sublime text doesn't allow out of the box).

# Usage
Toggle current view to a "RawLineEdit" view via the command palette command `Raw Line Edit: Toggle` (you can setup your own keybinding or add it to your context menu if you choose).   File must exist on disk.

Using `Enter` key you can change Windows style line endings to Unix or use `Shift+Enter` to do the opposite.  Select multiple lines to change more than one line.

# Settings

```javascript
    // Use a glyph for a visual representation
    // for newlines
    "use_newline_glyph": true,

    // Use the raw line edit theme to allow
    // a view that highlights only new lines
    // and carriage returns for easy visualization.
    // (Colors customizable via your color scheme file)
    "use_raw_line_edit_theme": true
```

# Colorize Line Endings

        <dict>
            <key>name</key>
            <string>Raw New Line: Carriage Rerturn</string>
